### About Department of Social Services

The Department of Social Services (DSS) is comprised of the administrative units of the New York City Human Resources Administration (HRA) and the Department of Homeless Services (DHS).  HRA is dedicated to fighting poverty and income inequality by providing New Yorkers in need with essential benefits such as Food Assistance and Emergency Rental Assistance.  DHS is committed to preventing and addressing homelessness in New York City by employing a variety of innovative strategies to help families and individuals successfully exit shelter and return to self-sufficiency as quickly as possible.

### About Department of Homeless Services

Governed by a unique right to shelter mandate, New York City provides temporary emergency shelter to every man, woman, and child who is eligible for services, every night. New York City’s shelter system is consistently recognized as the most sophisticated and comprehensive in the nation. The City is also an innovative leader in the field of preventive services for those who are at risk of becoming homeless.
The Department of Homeless Services (nyc.gov/dhs) works with partners to prevent homelessness when possible; to provide temporary, emergency shelter when needed; and to help individuals and families transition rapidly into permanent housing. We do this through providing coordinated, compassionate, high-quality services and supports.

### About Street Homeless Solutions

For individuals unwilling to enter the traditional shelter system Street Homeless Solutions provides an array of services to street homeless individuals to assist them off the street and to address mental health, substance abuse, and other issues. The City contracts with nonprofit providers to operate street Outreach Teams, Drop-In Centers and Safe Havens. Outreach teams work in all five boroughs and the subway with unsheltered individuals living on the streets of New York City.

###About Information Technology Services

Information Technology Services (ITS) is DSS’s technology services organization. Its mission is to support the daily, emergent, and long-term needs of both agencies.  ITS creates and enhances the technology infrastructure and computer applications that support HRA and DHS and develops applications, including a variety of client eligibility and recertification systems, case management systems, housing systems, employment/work engagement services, revenue producing computer matches, claiming systems, and personnel systems. 

###About StreetSmart

StreetSmart is the City’s in-house developed case management system that was built to address the unique business needs of the Outreach providers. StreetSmart has already improved customer service and increased productivity by providing client overview dashboards, search, filtering, and exportable data to generate reports. It also offers robust researching of client details - case management, engagements, placements, health information, and critical incidents. StreetSmart was built in 2016-2017 by a DSS ITS team practicing agile software development and working with a product manager to gather end user requirements in an interactive, ongoing manner, with user-centered design principles articulated by New York City’s Civic Service Design Studio (civicservicedesign.com). StreetSmart has been recognized in publications including WIRED, Mashable, Endgadget, and Government Technology.
Starting in July, 2019 StreetSmart will be expanded to cover the user needs for Street Homeless Solutions’ other two program areas, Drop-In Centers and Safe Havens. 
We’re looking for a candidate with digital product experience who’s excited about bringing modern software development and user centered design into city government to support the NYC Department of Homeless Services’ work with street homeless individuals to bring them on the path to stable housing.
